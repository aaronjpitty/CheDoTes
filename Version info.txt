Comments added
Started creating Rook move() method - does not cause issues for rest of program but is not fully implemented
Rook had many issues, spent time fixing, still not properly finding available places but is working
Rook now working! Partially! It will display areas rook can go to in yellow but does not take into account other pieces.
Stuff works
Rook now gets stopped by other pieces. Should be simpler to implement other movements now.
Rook cannot move onto areas that are not valid, yay. Will now attempt other pieces.
Pawn now partially working and not throwing errors currently.
Pawns now have move and firstMove working. Need to implement capture and no capturing straight forward.
Pawns can no longer move backwards.
Pawns can now capture.
Bishops partially working. Square rules need reworking as they cannot be applied to rook. Only works on 'straight' movement.
Bishops still bad.
King working.
Knight working.
Rook no longer allowed to sit on same position as a move.
Queen partially working, has same problems as Bishop.
Pawns behaving again?
Still working on diagonal movement.
Tidied up movement stuff.
En passant working.
Promotion working.
Some stuff seems odd - investigate.
Commenting.
Promotion screws up pawns, promoted pawn works but when removed claims 'pawn removed' and other pawns have affected movement.
Castling partially implemented. Needs to change boolean for castling possible.
Castling fully implemented, promotion still strange.
King now moving properly, had been affected by castling.
Attempted check.
